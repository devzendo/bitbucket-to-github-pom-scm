This Perl 5 script requires no dependencies, and will convert the scm block of a
pom.xml that refers to a BitBucket Mercurial repository into one that refers to
a GitHub one.

It is intended to be used after a BitBucket Mercurial repository has been
converted to a GitHub Git repository.

Usage: bitbucket-to-github-pom-scm.pl

git add pom.xml # etc., commit, etc.
